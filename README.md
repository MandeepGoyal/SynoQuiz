Developed a Python based word game application to test userâ€™s vocabulary relevant to GRE, GMAT, and SAT 
exams.

The application utilizes BeautifulSoup package to extract keywords for a specific exam and prompts users to 
provide synonyms for these words.

The application uses REST APIs to verify user responses, displaying their score and providing meanings for 
incorrect answers at the end of the game.
